# Essential Scrum

*by Kenneth S. Rubin*

`Notes by Henry Cooksley`

### Preface

"Scrum is based on a small set of core values, principles, and practices (collectively the Scrum framework)."

### 1. Introduction

"Scrum is an agile approach for developing innovative products and services."

"With an agile approach, you begin by creating a product backlog - a prioritized list of the features and other capabilities needed to develop a successful product."

"The work itself is performed in short, timeboxed iterations, which usually range from a week to a calendar month in length."

"During each iteration, a self-organizing, cross-functional team does all of the work - such as designing, building, and testing - required to produce completed, working features that could be put into production."

"At the end of the iteration, the team reviews the completed features with the stakeholders to get their feedback."

"Scrum's focus on delivering working, integrated, tested, business-valuable features each iteration leads to results being delivered fast."

"The Cynefin framework is a sense-making framework that helps us understand the situation in which we have to operate and decide on a situation-appropriate approach."

"It defines and compares the characteristics of five different domains: simple, complicated, chaotic, complex, and a fifth domain, disorder, which occurs when you don't know which other domain you are in."

"When dealing with complex problems, things are more unpredictable than they are predictable."

"We need to explore to learn about the problem, then inspect and adapt based on our learning."

"Scrum is particularly well suited for operating in a complex domain."

"Complicated problems are the domain of good practices dominated by experts."

"There might be multiple right answers, but expert diagnosis is required to figure them out."

"Although Scrum can certainly work with these problems, it might not be the best solution."

"When dealing with simple problems, everyone can see cause and effect."

"This is the domain of legitimate best practices."

"Chaotic problems require a rapid response."

"We are in a crisis and need to act immediately to prevent further harm and reestablish at least some order."

"You are in the disorder domain when you don't know which of the other domains you are in."

"Scrum is not well suited to highly interrupt-driven work."

"In interrupt-driven environments you would be better off considering an alternative agile approach called Kanban."

"The sweet spots for Kanban are the software maintenance and support areas."

## 1. Core Concepts

### 2. Scrum Framework

"The Scrum framework is based on a set of values, principles, and practices that provide the foundation to which your organization will add its unique implementation of relevant engineering practices and your specific approaches for realizing the Scrum practices."

"To better grasp the framework concept, imagine that the Scrum framework is like the foundation and walls of a building."

"You can't ignore or fundamentally change a value, principle, or practice without risking collapse."

"What you can do, however, is customize the inside of the structure of Scrum, adding fixtures and features until you have a process that works for you."

"Scrum is a refreshingly simple, people-centric framework based on the values of honesty, openness, courage, respect, focus, trust, empowerment, and collaboration."

"Scrum development efforts consist of one or more Scrum teams, each made up of three Scrum roles: product owner, ScrumMaster, and the development team."

"The product owner is responsible for what will be developed and in what order."

"The ScrumMaster is responsible for guiding the team in creating and following its own process based on the broader Scrum framework."

"The development team is responsible for determining how to deliver what the product owner has asked for."

"The product owner has a vision of what he wants to create (the big cube)."

"Because the cube can be large, through an activity called grooming it is broken down into a set of features that are collected into a prioritized list called the product backlog."

"A sprint starts with sprint planning, encompasses the development work during the sprint (called sprint execution), and ends with the review and retrospective."

"Using Scrum, we always do the most valuable work first."

"The product owner collaborates with internal and external stakeholders to gather and define the product backlog items."

"In Scrum, work is performed in iterations or cycles of up to a calendar month called sprints."

"Sprints are timeboxed so they always have a fixed start and end date, and generally they should all be of the same duration."

"During sprint planning, the product owner and development team agree on a sprint goal that defines what the upcoming sprint is supposed to achieve."

"Using this goal, the development team reviews the product backlog and determines the high-priority items that the team can realistically accomplish in the upcoming sprint while working at a sustainable pace - a pace at which the development team can comfortably work for an extended period of time."

"Each day of the sprint, ideally at the same time, the development team members hold a timeboxed (15 minutes or less) daily scrum."

"This inspect-and-adapt activity is sometimes referred to as the daily stand-up because of the common practice of everyone standing up during the meeting to help promote brevity."

"What did I accomplish since the last daily scrum?"

"What do I plan to work on by the next daily scrum?"

"What are the obstacles or impediments that are preventing me from making progress?"

"The daily scrum is not a problem-solving activity."

"Mainly, the daily scrum is an inspection, synchronization, and adaptive daily planning activity that helps a self-organizing team do its job better."

"In Scrum, we refer to the sprint results as a potentially shippable product increment, meaning that whatever the Scrum team agreed to do is really done according to its agreed-upon definition of done."

"Potentially shippable is better thought of as a state of confidence that what got built in the sprint is actually done, meaning that there isn't materially important undone work (such as important testing or integration and so on) that needs to be completed before we can ship the results from the sprint, if shipping is our business desire."

"A successful review results in bidirectional information flow."

"Whereas the sprint review is a time to inspect and adapt the product, the sprint retrospective is an opportunity to inspect and adapt the process."

"After the sprint retrospective is completed, the whole cycle is repeated again - starting with the next sprint-planning session, held to determine the current highest-value set of work for the team to focus on."

### 3. Agile Principles

"The goal of comparing agile principles with traditional development principles is not to make the case that plan-driven, sequential development is bad and that Scrum is good."

"Plan-driven processes are so named because they attempt to plan for and anticipate up front all of the features a user might want in the end product, and to determine how best to build those features."

"Plan-driven development works well if you are applying it to problems that are well defined, predictable, and unlikely to undergo any significant change."

"Scrum leverages the variability and uncertainty in product development to create innovative solutions."

"Iterative development acknowledges that we will probably get things wrong before we get them right and that we will do things poorly before we do them well."

"If we make a mistake during analysis and find it during analysis, it is an inexpensive fix."

"If that same error is not found until design, we have to fix not only the incorrect requirement, but potentially parts of our design based on the wrong requirement."

"When developing a product, the balance point should be set in an economically sensible way to maximize the amount of ongoing adaptation based on fast feedback and minimize the amount of up-front prediction, while still meeting compliance, regulatory, and/or corporate objectives."

"In Scrum, we try to minimize the number of important assumptions that exist at any time."

"The Scrum framework is also flexible enough to embrace many other learning loops."

"For example, although not specified by Scrum, technical practice feedback loops, such as pair programming (feedback in seconds) and test-driven development (feedback in minutes), are frequently used with Scrum development."

"Feedback-generating activities that occur a long time after development have unfortunate side effects, such as turning integration into a large test-and-fix phase, because components developed disjointedly from each other frequently don't integrate smoothly."

"In Scrum, we accept that although economies-of-scale thinking has been a bedrock principle in manufacturing, applying it dogmatically to product development will cause significant economic harm."

"The idle work (delayed work) grows exponentially once we get into the high levels of utilization."

"So, in Scrum, we are acutely aware that finding the bottlenecks in the flow of work and focusing our efforts on eliminating them is a far more economically sensible activity than trying to keep everyone 100% busy."

"With Scrum, we measure progress by building working, validated assets that deliver value and that can be used to validate important assumptions."

"In Scrum, value is generated by delivering working assets to customers, by validating important assumptions, or by acquiring valuable knowledge."

"In Scrum, time is of the essence, but we don't rush to get things done."

"Doing so would likely violate the Scrum principle of sustainable pace - people should be able to work at a pace that they can continue for an extended period of time."

"Plan-driven processes tend to be high-ceremony, document-centric, process-heavy approaches."

"A side effect of Scrum's being value-centric is that very little emphasis is on process-centric ceremonies."

"In Scrum, our goal is to eliminate unnecessary formality."

"Therefore, we set the ceremonial bar at a low level, one that is minimally sufficient (some call it barely sufficient) or good enough."

### 4. Sprints

"They are timeboxed, have a short and consistent duration, have a goal that shouldn't be altered once started, and must reach the end state specified by the team's definition of done."

"Timeboxing is a technique for limiting the amount of WIP (work in process).

"Completing some work toward those features ensures that valuable, measurable progress is being made each sprint."

"Timeboxing helps avoid unnecessary perfectionism."

"The fact that the end of the sprint brings with it a hard deadline encourages team members to diligently apply themselves to complete the work on time."

"Timeboxing improves predictability."

"Scrum provides managers, stakeholders, product owners, and others with many more checkpoints than they would have with sequential projects."

"The sprint goal is the foundation of a mutual commitment made by the team and the product owner."

"The team commits to meeting the goal by the end of the sprint, and the product owner commits to not altering the goal during the sprint."

"A change is any alteration in work or resources that has the potential to generate economically meaningful waste, harmfully disrupt the flow of work, or substantially increase the scope of work within a sprint."

"Most of the time, a bare-minimum definition of done should yield a complete slice of product functionality, one that has been designed, built, integrated, tested, and documented and would deliver validated customer value."

"Sprints provide the essential Scrum skeleton on which most other activities and artifacts can be placed."

### 5. Requirements and User Stories

"In Scrum, the details of a requirement are negotiated through conversations that happen continuously during development and are fleshed out just in time and just enough for the teams to start building functionality to support that requirement."

"Initially the product backlog items are large (representing large swaths of business value), and there is very little detail associated with them."

"Eventually a product backlog item is small and detailed enough to move into a spring, where it will be designed, built, and tested."

"Requirements that we'll work on sooner will be smaller and more detailed than ones that we won't work on for some time."

"One of the benefits of using user stories is that they shift some of the focus away from writing and onto conversations."

"User stories are an excellent vehicle for carrying items of customer or user value through the Scrum value-creation flow."

"However, if we have only one story size (the size that would comfortably fit within a short-duration sprint), it will be difficult to do higher-level planning and to reap the benefits of progressive refinement."

"The largest would be stories that are a few to many months in size and might span an entire release or multiple releases."

"Epics are helpful because they give a very big-picture, high-level overview of what is desired."

"Tasks are the layer below stories, typically worked on by only one person, or perhaps a pair of people."

"Tasks typically require hours to perform."

"It is important to keep in mind that terms like epic, feature, story, and theme are just labels of convenience, and they are not universally shared."

"How do we know if the stories that we have written are good stories?"

"The INVEST criteria are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimatable, Small (sized appropriately), and Testable."

"Stories need to be valuable to a customer, user, or both."

"If a story isn't valuable to either, it doesn't belong in the product backlog."

"The fundamental problem with technical stories is that the product owner might not perceive any value in them, making it difficult if not impossible to prioritize them against business-valuable stories."

"Sometimes we need to create a product backlog item that focuses on knowledge acquisition."

"One difference between traditional story-writing workshops and story mapping is that during the workshop we are primarily focused on generating stories and not so focused on prioritizing them (the vertical position of implementable stories within a story map)."

### 6. Product Backlog

"The product backlog is a prioritized list of desired product functionality."

"It provides a centralized and shared understanding of what to build and the order in which to build it."

"As new items are added or existing items are refined, the product owner must rebalance and reprioritize the product backlog, taking the new information into account."

"Grooming the product backlog is an ongoing collaborative effort led by the product owner and including significant participation from internal and external stakeholders as well as the ScrumMaster and development team."

"Based on these characteristics, most organizations address the large-product problem by creating hierarchical backlogs."

### 7. Estimation and Velocity

"To answer these questions using Scrum, we need to estimate the size of what we are building and measure the velocity or rate at which we can get work done."

"One we know the approximate size of the release, we turn our attention to the team's velocity, how much work the team typically gets done each sprint."

"The sum of the sizes of all the completed product backlog items in a sprint is the team's velocity for that sprint."

"Although the portfolio backlog is not formally a part of Scrum, many organizations maintain one that contains a prioritized list of all of the products (or projects) that need to be built."

"Once a product or project is approved and we start adding more detail to its product backlog items, however, we need to estimate differently."

"When PBIs have risen in priority and been groomed to include more detail, most teams prefer to put numeric size estimates on them, using ether story points or ideal days."

"Tasks are sized in ideal hours (also referred to as effort-hours, man-hours, or person-hours)."

"In Scrum, we follow a simple rule: The people who will do the work collectively provide the estimates."

"Estimates are not commitments, and it is important that we do not treat them as such."

"If I then tell them their bonuses will be based on the estimate being correct, everyone, including me, will give a much larger estimate than the one we originally thought was correct."

"We don't want them artificially inflated due to external influences."

"When all is said and done, we have no real understanding of the numbers because they have been manipulated so many times by different people."

"Although there is no standard unit for PBI size estimates, by far the two most common units are story points and ideal days."

"Story points combine factors like complexity and physical size into one relative size measure."

"If there is a low risk of misinterpretation in your organization, ideal time will likely work just fine."

"If you believe people will misinterpret ideal time, you're better off using story points."

"Planning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating effort."

"The most frequently used scale is the one proposed by Mike Cohn, based in part on a modified Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, and 100."

"In Planning Poker we don't take averages or use any number not on the scale/cards."

"Usually this consensus can be achieved within two or three rounds of voting, during which the team members' focused discussion helps obtain a shared understanding of the story."

"The majority of the value associated with Planning Poker is the discussion and better understanding that team members will share about the PBIs."

"Velocity is the amount of work completed each sprint."

"It is measured by adding the sizes of the PBIs that are completed by the end of the sprint."

"For planning purposed, velocity is most useful when expressed as a range, such as “The team is typically able to complete between 25 and 30 points each sprint.”"

"Velocity is used as a planning tool and as a team diagnostic metric."

"It should not be used as a performance metric in an attempt to judge team productivity."

### 8. Technical Debt

"Cunningham used the technical debt metaphor to explain to his business team why creating software fast to get feedback was a good thing."

"The team and organization need to be vigilant about repayment of the debt as their understanding of the business domain improves, and the design and implementation of the system need to evolve to better embrace that understanding."

"Cunningham didn't intend for technical debt to refer to team member or business immaturity or process deficiencies that lead to sloppy design, poor engineering practices, and a lack of testing."

"In addition, there is unavoidable technical debt, which is usually unpredictable and unpreventable."

"The final type of technical debt is strategic technical debt."

"For example, an organization might deliberately make a strategic decision to take shortcuts during product development to achieve an important short-term goal, such as getting a time-sensitive product into the marketplace."

"We can choose to continue paying the interest (by working around the problems), or we can pay down the debt principal (for example, by refactoring the code to make it cleaner and easier to modify)."

"The reality is that reducing testing will both increase debt and cause us to go slower, because problems will go undetected until later when it is much more time-consuming to fix them."

"Future technical debt builds quickly on top of existing technical debt."

"The result is the kind of product in which we are terrified to make any changes, because a small change in one area could cause 18 other things to break in what appear to be totally unrelated areas of the product."

"Technical debt management requires a balanced technical and business discussion that must involve technical and business people."

"Although Scrum does not formally define technical practices, every successful Scrum team that I have seen employs practices such as simple design, test-driven development, continuous integration, automated testing, refactoring, and so on."

"The more technically encompassing we make our definition-of-done checklist, the less likely we are to accrue technical debt."

"In my experience, most organizations substantially underestimate the true cost of assuming technical debt and aren't nearly as diligent as they think they will be at repaying it."

"The problem in many organizations is that whereas the development team has at least some reasonable visibility into the product's technical debt position, the business people typically do not."

"A way that some organizations do make visible the business consequences of technical debt is by tracking velocity over time."

"Another approach to making technical debt visible is to create product backlog items that represent technical debt."

"A third approach to making technical debt visible is to create a special technical debt backlog that makes individual technical debt items visible."

"There are a number of scenarios under which technical debt should not be repaid."

"If a product has accrued significant technical debt and it is approaching end of life, investing in any substantial technical debt repayment would be fiscally irresponsible."

"A common example would be the development of a throwaway prototype that is created for knowledge-acquisition purposes."

"If we build a product for a very short production life, the economics might dictate that technical debt should not be repaid."

"There is a Boy Scout rule: “Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.”"

"Following this rule, we try to always make our product design and implementation a little better, not a little worse, every time we touch it."

"In some products the accrued technical debt level might be quite high."

"Teams working on such products frequently end up making large balloon payments as a means of servicing their debt load."

"They would be far better off if they made many, timely, incremental payments against known technical debt instead of large late payments."

"Although it is convenient to lump all types of shortcuts or deficiencies under one label of technical debt, it is important to realize that not all types of technical debt are of equal importance."

"When servicing technical debt, therefore, we should target and service the high-interest technical debt first."

"An excellent way to repay known technical debt incrementally, while focusing on high-interest technical debt and aligning technical debt servicing with the Scrum value-centric approach, is to make debt payments while performing customer-valuable work."

"Instead, we should service known technical debt coincident with the development of customer-valuable features in the product backlog."

## 2. Roles

### 9. Product Owner

"The product owner is the empowered central point of product leadership."

"On one hand, the product owner must understand the needs and priorities of the organizational stakeholders, the customers, and the users well enough to act as their voice."

"On the other hand, the product owner must communicate to the development team what to build and the order in which to build it."

"In these respects the product owner is part business analyst and part tester."

"The product owner is responsible for ensuring that good economic decisions are continuously being made at the release, sprint, and product backlog levels."

"In addition to release-level economics, the product owner also manages sprint-level economics, ensuring that a good return on investment (ROI) is delivered from each sprint."

"The product owner is responsible for defining the acceptance criteria for each product backlog item."

"The product owner is the single voice of the entire stakeholder community, internal and external."

"Internal stakeholders can include business systems owners, executive management, program management, marketing, and sales."

"External stakeholders can include customers, users, partners, regulatory bodies, and others."

"The product owner is a visionary who can synthesize a product vision and lead the team to achieve that vision."

"On a commercial development effort – for example, a company building a product for sale to external customers – the product owner should be an organization employee who acts as the voice of the actual customers."

"On an outsourced development effort – for example, company A contracting with company B to build a solution – a representative from company A should be the product owner."

### 10. ScrumMaster

"The ScrumMaster acts as a coach to both the development team and the product owner."

"A ScrumMaster also provides process leadership, helping the Scrum team and the rest of the organization develop their own high performance, organization-specific Scrum approach."

"People who are in a technical leadership position are there for a reason – they are technically very good at what they do."

"Any time technical leaders are doing ScrumMaster work, they are necessarily providing less technical leadership."

### 11. Development Team

"Testing should be fully interwoven into the work that takes place during every sprint."

"Whenever you can, you should create cross-functional teams."

"Self-organization is a bottom-up, emergent property of the system – there is no external dominating force applying traditional top-down, command-and-control management."

"Teams composed solely of people with the same skills (traditional silo teams) can at most do part of the job."

"Handoffs represent an excellent opportunity for miscommunication and costly mistakes."

"Flexible development teams are composed of members with T-shaped skills."

"Managers should focus on forming teams that have the best set of T-shaped skills that are possible with available personnel."

"High-bandwidth communications increase both the frequency and quality of information sharing."

"The currency of agile is the team."

### 12. Scrum Team Structures

"A feature team is a cross-functional and cross-component team that can pull end-customer features from the product backlog and complete them."

"A component team, on the other hand, focuses on the development of a component or subsystem that can be used to create only part of an end-customer feature."

"Scrum favors feature teams."

"A common approach to coordinating work among multiple teams is the scrum of scrums or SoS."

"A release train is an approach to aligning the vision, planning, and interdependencies of many teams by providing cross-team synchronization based on a common cadence."

### 13. Managers

"In this chapter I discuss the responsibilities of functional-area managers (also called resource managers), such as development managers, QA managers, and art directors, within a Scrum organization."

"Managers need to foster an environment where people are constantly learning and adding to their skill sets."

"On the surface there are some similarities between a ScrumMaster and a project manager – for example, both do impediment removal."

"However, being a servant leader significantly differentiates this role from a more command-and-control-focused project manager."

"Rather, the project manager is the person who is concerned with making sure that dependencies across the various areas are understood and communicated in a way so that the teams can most effectively coordinate their work with the other teams."
