# Essential Scrum

*by Kenneth S. Rubin*

`Notes by Henry Cooksley`

### Preface

"Scrum is based on a small set of core values, principles, and practices (collectively the Scrum framework)."

### 1. Introduction

"Scrum is an agile approach for developing innovative products and services."

"With an agile approach, you begin by creating a product backlog - a prioritized list of the features and other capabilities needed to develop a successful product."

"The work itself is performed in short, timeboxed iterations, which usually range from a week to a calendar month in length."

"During each iteration, a self-organizing, cross-functional team does all of the work - such as designing, building, and testing - required to produce completed, working features that could be put into production."

"At the end of the iteration, the team reviews the completed features with the stakeholders to get their feedback."

"Scrum's focus on delivering working, integrated, tested, business-valuable features each iteration leads to results being delivered fast."

"The Cynefin framework is a sense-making framework that helps us understand the situation in which we have to operate and decide on a situation-appropriate approach."

"It defines and compares the characteristics of five different domains: simple, complicated, chaotic, complex, and a fifth domain, disorder, which occurs when you don't know which other domain you are in."

"When dealing with complex problems, things are more unpredictable than they are predictable."

"We need to explore to learn about the problem, then inspect and adapt based on our learning."

"Scrum is particularly well suited for operating in a complex domain."

"Complicated problems are the domain of good practices dominated by experts."

"There might be multiple right answers, but expert diagnosis is required to figure them out."

"Although Scrum can certainly work with these problems, it might not be the best solution."

"When dealing with simple problems, everyone can see cause and effect."

"This is the domain of legitimate best practices."

"Chaotic problems require a rapid response."

"We are in a crisis and need to act immediately to prevent further harm and reestablish at least some order."

"You are in the disorder domain when you don't know which of the other domains you are in."

"Scrum is not well suited to highly interrupt-driven work."

"In interrupt-driven environments you would be better off considering an alternative agile approach called Kanban."

"The sweet spots for Kanban are the software maintenance and support areas."
