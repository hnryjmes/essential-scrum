# Essential Scrum

*by Kenneth S. Rubin*

`Notes by Henry Cooksley`

### Preface

"Scrum is based on a small set of core values, principles, and practices (collectively the Scrum framework)."

### 1. Introduction

"Scrum is an agile approach for developing innovative products and services."

"With an agile approach, you begin by creating a product backlog - a prioritized list of the features and other capabilities needed to develop a successful product."

"The work itself is performed in short, timeboxed iterations, which usually range from a week to a calendar month in length."

"During each iteration, a self-organizing, cross-functional team does all of the work - such as designing, building, and testing - required to produce completed, working features that could be put into production."

"At the end of the iteration, the team reviews the completed features with the stakeholders to get their feedback."

"Scrum's focus on delivering working, integrated, tested, business-valuable features each iteration leads to results being delivered fast."

"The Cynefin framework is a sense-making framework that helps us understand the situation in which we have to operate and decide on a situation-appropriate approach."

"It defines and compares the characteristics of five different domains: simple, complicated, chaotic, complex, and a fifth domain, disorder, which occurs when you don't know which other domain you are in."

"When dealing with complex problems, things are more unpredictable than they are predictable."

"We need to explore to learn about the problem, then inspect and adapt based on our learning."

"Scrum is particularly well suited for operating in a complex domain."

"Complicated problems are the domain of good practices dominated by experts."

"There might be multiple right answers, but expert diagnosis is required to figure them out."

"Although Scrum can certainly work with these problems, it might not be the best solution."

"When dealing with simple problems, everyone can see cause and effect."

"This is the domain of legitimate best practices."

"Chaotic problems require a rapid response."

"We are in a crisis and need to act immediately to prevent further harm and reestablish at least some order."

"You are in the disorder domain when you don't know which of the other domains you are in."

"Scrum is not well suited to highly interrupt-driven work."

"In interrupt-driven environments you would be better off considering an alternative agile approach called Kanban."

"The sweet spots for Kanban are the software maintenance and support areas."

## 1. Core Concepts

### 2. Scrum Framework

"The Scrum framework is based on a set of values, principles, and practices that provide the foundation to which your organization will add its unique implementation of relevant engineering practices and your specific approaches for realizing the Scrum practices."

"To better grasp the framework concept, imagine that the Scrum framework is like the foundation and walls of a building."

"You can't ignore or fundamentally change a value, principle, or practice without risking collapse."

"What you can do, however, is customize the inside of the structure of Scrum, adding fixtures and features until you have a process that works for you."

"Scrum is a refreshingly simple, people-centric framework based on the values of honesty, openness, courage, respect, focus, trust, empowerment, and collaboration."

"Scrum development efforts consist of one or more Scrum teams, each made up of three Scrum roles: product owner, ScrumMaster, and the development team."

"The product owner is responsible for what will be developed and in what order."

"The ScrumMaster is responsible for guiding the team in creating and following its own process based on the broader Scrum framework."

"The development team is responsible for determining how to deliver what the product owner has asked for."

"The product owner has a vision of what he wants to create (the big cube)."

"Because the cube can be large, through an activity called grooming it is broken down into a set of features that are collected into a prioritized list called the product backlog."

"A sprint starts with sprint planning, encompasses the development work during the sprint (called sprint execution), and ends with the review and retrospective."

"Using Scrum, we always do the most valuable work first."

"The product owner collaborates with internal and external stakeholders to gather and define the product backlog items."

"In Scrum, work is performed in iterations or cycles of up to a calendar month called sprints."

"Sprints are timeboxed so they always have a fixed start and end date, and generally they should all be of the same duration."

"During sprint planning, the product owner and development team agree on a sprint goal that defines what the upcoming sprint is supposed to achieve."

"Using this goal, the development team reviews the product backlog and determines the high-priority items that the team can realistically accomplish in the upcoming sprint while working at a sustainable pace - a pace at which the development team can comfortably work for an extended period of time."

"Each day of the sprint, ideally at the same time, the development team members hold a timeboxed (15 minutes or less) daily scrum."

"This inspect-and-adapt activity is sometimes referred to as the daily stand-up because of the common practice of everyone standing up during the meeting to help promote brevity."

"What did I accomplish since the last daily scrum?"

"What do I plan to work on by the next daily scrum?"

"What are the obstacles or impediments that are preventing me from making progress?"

"The daily scrum is not a problem-solving activity."

"Mainly, the daily scrum is an inspection, synchronization, and adaptive daily planning activity that helps a self-organizing team do its job better."

"In Scrum, we refer to the sprint results as a potentially shippable product increment, meaning that whatever the Scrum team agreed to do is really done according to its agreed-upon definition of done."

"Potentially shippable is better thought of as a state of confidence that what got built in the sprint is actually done, meaning that there isn't materially important undone work (such as important testing or integration and so on) that needs to be completed before we can ship the results from the sprint, if shipping is our business desire."

"A successful review results in bidirectional information flow."

"Whereas the sprint review is a time to inspect and adapt the product, the sprint retrospective is an opportunity to inspect and adapt the process."

"After the sprint retrospective is completed, the whole cycle is repeated again - starting with the next sprint-planning session, held to determine the current highest-value set of work for the team to focus on."

### 3. Agile Principles

"The goal of comparing agile principles with traditional development principles is not to make the case that plan-driven, sequential development is bad and that Scrum is good."

"Plan-driven processes are so named because they attempt to plan for and anticipate up front all of the features a user might want in the end product, and to determine how best to build those features."

"Plan-driven development works well if you are applying it to problems that are well defined, predictable, and unlikely to undergo any significant change."

"Scrum leverages the variability and uncertainty in product development to create innovative solutions."

"Iterative development acknowledges that we will probably get things wrong before we get them right and that we will do things poorly before we do them well."

"If we make a mistake during analysis and find it during analysis, it is an inexpensive fix."

"If that same error is not found until design, we have to fix not only the incorrect requirement, but potentially parts of our design based on the wrong requirement."

"When developing a product, the balance point should be set in an economically sensible way to maximize the amount of ongoing adaptation based on fast feedback and minimize the amount of up-front prediction, while still meeting compliance, regulatory, and/or corporate objectives."

"In Scrum, we try to minimize the number of important assumptions that exist at any time."

"The Scrum framework is also flexible enough to embrace many other learning loops."

"For example, although not specified by Scrum, technical practice feedback loops, such as pair programming (feedback in seconds) and test-driven development (feedback in minutes), are frequently used with Scrum development."

"Feedback-generating activities that occur a long time after development have unfortunate side effects, such as turning integration into a large test-and-fix phase, because components developed disjointedly from each other frequently don't integrate smoothly."

"In Scrum, we accept that although economies-of-scale thinking has been a bedrock principle in manufacturing, applying it dogmatically to product development will cause significant economic harm."

"The idle work (delayed work) grows exponentially once we get into the high levels of utilization."

"So, in Scrum, we are acutely aware that finding the bottlenecks in the flow of work and focusing our efforts on eliminating them is a far more economically sensible activity than trying to keep everyone 100% busy."

"With Scrum, we measure progress by building working, validated assets that deliver value and that can be used to validate important assumptions."

"In Scrum, value is generated by delivering working assets to customers, by validating important assumptions, or by acquiring valuable knowledge."

"In Scrum, time is of the essence, but we don't rush to get things done."

"Doing so would likely violate the Scrum principle of sustainable pace - people should be able to work at a pace that they can continue for an extended period of time."

"Plan-driven processes tend to be high-ceremony, document-centric, process-heavy approaches."

"A side effect of Scrum's being value-centric is that very little emphasis is on process-centric ceremonies."

"In Scrum, our goal is to eliminate unnecessary formality."

"Therefore, we set the ceremonial bar at a low level, one that is minimally sufficient (some call it barely sufficient) or good enough."
